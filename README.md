We were asked to make a small web application with a few features that employers may like. 
I created a search function along with a section allowing employers to upload their own jobs. 
This code has no link to a DB (all code is client side). 
Any suggestions to my code is welcome! 
I love learning more and it would be awesome to hear some of your improvements!
